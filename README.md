This program was created for Oakland University's CSI 2300 class, Object-Oriented Computing. In this class, I learned about Java and the basics of object-oriented computing. I created a tic-tac-toe game with a GUI, inheritance, and I/O functionality. I designed a GUI for the layout of the tic-tac-toe frame, with button functionalities to choose between two different computer difficulties and a two-player mode. I also included functionality to clear the board and reset to a new game. There is also a menu to select a user and store that user's win/loss count upon request. The game mechanics utilize inheritance between the two difficulty modes to choose to play a random move or "scan" the board for a more advanced one. I/O is implemented to read and write user data to a separate text file.

These files were imported to GitHub after the completion of the project, so past versions are not available.
