This program was created for Oakland University's CSI 2300 class, Object-Oriented Computing. In this class I learned about Java and the basics of object-oriented computing. I created a GUI for the layout of the tic-tac-toe frame, with functionalities to choose between 2 different computer difficulties and a 2-player mode. I also included functionality to clear the board and reset to a new game. There is also the function to select a user and store that users win/loss count upon request. The game mechanics utliize inheritance between the two difficulty modes to choose to play a random move or "scan" the board for a more advanced one. i/o is implemented to read and write user data to a seperate text file. 

These files were imported to Github after the completion of the project, so past versions are not available.
